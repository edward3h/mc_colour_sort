# Base Project

This is a template for common stuff I include in all my projects.

To use:

- Generate project from template in Github.
- Edit the script/bootstrap script to add any dependencies.
  - But not ones that are better represented by a project specific package
    manager... (e.g. yarn, gradle)
- Replace this README with one relevant to the real project.
